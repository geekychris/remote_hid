I want a way to remotely control a keyboard and mouse.  The idea is that we have an agent that can be installed on a windows or macintosh computer that we will call the HID Client.  This HID Client when started will connect to a session service with some kind of username / password.  There will be another client used by an operator that also connects to the session service.  This client we will call the commander.  The commander when run will allow the operator connect to the session service and specify a HID Client to talk to.  The Commander then allows its operator to use their keyboard and mouse to remotely control keyboard and mouse input on the HID Client machine.  The session server providing a way for both clients to connect to one another and to forward keyboard and mouse instructions to the HID Client.  This is for remote control of keyboard and mouse.  All code can be written in c or rust and should include tests and documentation along with full build scripts and build instructions.  Documentation describing its design and underlying libraries used to achieve this should also be documented.
